# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I showcase a collection of data analytics projects from my professional and personal endeavors. As a recent graduate with a Master's in Business Analytics from Wake Forest University's School of Business, I aim to demonstrate my skills for the job market.

Throughout my professional experience, I've engaged in diverse projects, including collaborating with startups, where I reported directly to the founders, to an internship at ASM Global, where I spearheaded various analytics projects and reported to the general manager.

On this page, you'll find demonstrations of my proficiency in coding, data visualization, dashboard creation, data science methodologies, problem-solving, report writing, and the foundational principles of data analytics.

I hope this portfolio effectively illustrates the potential I bring to the table as I embark on my career in data analytics. Thank you for visiting!

## 4. Data Analytics and Science Expertise and Projects: Classification, Training and Testing Models, Forecasting, Sentiment Analysis, Facial Recognition, Data Visualizations, Data Wrangling, and Exploratory Data Analysis

### [Project 1: Fighting Fraud with Python, SQL and Excel](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/SQL%20Project%20Files/Assignment_5_Visuals.xlsx)
The goal of this project is to prevent fraudsters who are opening fake accounts in a legitimate customer's name. The big problem that these fraudsters cause is that they transfer funds from the legit customer to these fraudulent accounts, after a period of time, they then close the account and run off with the money. In my analysis, I first extract a table of data from a Postgres cloud database, second I enrich the data in Python by extracting unique IP addresses and parsing the JSON responses to which I store the enriched dataset back into the MySQL database, third I build a classification model to predict the Fraud or Legit in Python, and use Excel to create visuals.

This unique project dives into a new realm of analytics by working with unstructured text data, and performing analytics. The core of this project is to see how many words and what words my resume matches with a job posting description. This project serves as a great indicator for what skills and words I may be missing on my resume, which could tell me what next steps I may need to take to improve my chances in the job search process.

### [Project 3: Boston House Prices](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Juypter%20Notebook%20Files/Project_6_Boston.ipynb)
The main goal of this project was to choose which linear regression models predict assessed value for the property the best, which was determined by performing EDA and using statistical methods (e.g. R-Squared). The analytics guideline that I used is as follows: 1. Understanding the Data with a basic data summary, 2. Univariate Analysis on both the target and features, 3. Bivariate Analysis for each feature with respect to the target variable, 4. Multivariate Analysis (Heatmap, Pair Plots, and Multivariate Regression Plots), 5. Outlier Detection and Treatment (Use Z-Score or IQR to detect outliers and decide whether to remove, cap/floor, or transform outliers).

### [Project 4: Organic Products Case Study](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Juypter%20Notebook%20Files/Project_3_Classification.ipynb)
This case study discovers a business problem that many organizations in the supermarket industry may face, which is determining what factors contribute to the likelihood of customers purchasing a particular good and developing a profile of the typical customer that purchases organic products. The supermarket's management is very eager to find the customer who purchases organic products as they are aware that these type of customers are highly profitable. Here, I train many models and perform deep analysis to provide insights and recommendations for the organization.

In this group project, my colleague and I were asked to use several analytical techniques in Python that go from simple models like regressions to more complex models like classification trees and K-means clustering, and finally we had to report our findings. The focus of the topic revolves around questions such as the following: around what key factors drive the nightly rental price for units in the Austin area, what are the key factors driving the probability of keeping a unit booked in the Austin area, how important are guest reviews and ratings, and etc.

### [Project 7: Identity Verification and Who Came to Class with Face Recognition and AWS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yB_ke947xCOHb3w_HsiWucZI1Pc5Osf2?usp=drive_link)
Goal of this project: You are working for a company that wants to use Facial Biometrics (Face Recognition) to ensure that their employees are returning to work! In your case, we are looking at who came to class and whether we can reliably verify identities by comparing faces. In particular, the company is interested in comparing the performance, pros, and cons of the opensource package “facial_recognition” against the Amazon ReKognition API service. To do this they have cooked up two use cases for you to analyze. First how well do the two packages do on facial recognition simply comparing two faces to one another, and second how well can we recognize known faces in an image.

Objective of the project: You’ve just been invited to interview with the machine learning team at a large financial institution. Their job is to find fraud, waste, and abuse in their payment stream. You have been presented with a sample dataset of transactions and a holdout set, your job is to walk through your process of exploring the data, building model(s), and evaluating them. Your target variable is called EVENT_LABEL and contains a label "legit" or "fraud". There is a data dictionary at the end of this project.

You will train and evaluate three different models.

Logistic Regression: Serves as a baseline for performance comparison.

### [Project 10: Revisiting Loan Default Project, Can you Predict Loan Default?](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Juypter%20Notebook%20Files/Anthony_Ayala_Final_Project_Loan_Defaults.ipynb)
You’ve recently joined a major financial institution and are tasked with developing and comparing several machine learning models to predict “loan status”. Specifically which loans are likely to default. Since we now work in a regulated industry, we need to ensure that our models are both explainable and that the predictions that we create can be explained; and most importantly we can document what we did!

You will train and evaluate different models:
Logistic Regression: Serves as a baseline for performance comparison.
Random Forest: An ensemble method known for its robustness and ability to handle complex data structures.
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) OR XGBoost: Advanced ensemble techniques known for their predictive power.
Neural Network: An approximation method known for it’s ability to identify non-linear relationships.
StackingClassifier or AutoGluon Weighted Ensemble.

## 5. Personal Projects and Extra Tools and Techniques

### [Project 1: Web Scraping 101](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Juypter%20Notebook%20Files/Web%20Scraping%20Practice)
I decided to learn how to web scrape in Python to collect data and add more tools to my analytics skills set to achieve creating a live dashboard for my analytics internship.
