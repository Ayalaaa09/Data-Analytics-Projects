# Data-Analytics-Projects

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I showcase a collection of data analytics projects from my professional and personal endeavors. As a recent graduate with a Master's in Business Analytics from Wake Forest University's School of Business, I aim to demonstrate my skills for the job market.

Throughout my professional experience, I've engaged in diverse projects, including collaborating with startups, where I reported directly to the founders, to an internship at ASM Global, where I spearheaded various analytics projects and reported to the general manager.

On this page, you'll find demonstrations of my proficiency in coding, data visualization, dashboard creation, data science methodologies, problem-solving, report writing, and the foundational principles of data analytics.

I hope this portfolio effectively illustrates the potential I bring to the table as I embark on my career in data analytics. Thank you for visiting!
