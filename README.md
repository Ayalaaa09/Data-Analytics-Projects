# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I showcase a collection of data analytics projects from my professional and personal endeavors. As a recent graduate with a Master's in Business Analytics from Wake Forest University's School of Business, I aim to demonstrate my skills for the job market.

Throughout my professional experience, I've engaged in diverse projects, including collaborating with startups, where I reported directly to the founders, to an internship at ASM Global, where I spearheaded various analytics projects and reported to the general manager.

On this page, you'll find demonstrations of my proficiency in coding, data visualization, dashboard creation, data science methodologies, problem-solving, report writing, and the foundational principles of data analytics.

I hope this portfolio effectively illustrates the potential I bring to the table as I embark on my career in data analytics. Thank you for visiting!

## 1. Demonstrating Proficiency in Programming Languages (Python, SQL, and R)

### [Project 1: Introduction to Python](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Juypter%20Notebook%20Files/Intro_to_python_Anthony_Ayala.ipynb)
This is my first project assigned in the Master's program that had a focus on applying my beginner Python skills to work with dictionaries, lists, and different types of data. 
- Data: MSBA Alumni Database (Collecting Data from LinkedIn)

### [Project 2: Pandas & Visualization 101](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Juypter%20Notebook%20Files/Pandas_viz_101_Anthony_Ayala.ipynb)
Worked on Data Manipulation with Pandas and Numpy, and visualized clean data with Seaborn and Matplotlib. This project showcases exploratory data analysis, answering potential questions about the data and the business, and creating a naive chatbot that can answer simple questions about the data.
- Data: Amazon Reviews of Products in Beauty and Personal Care.
  
### [Project 3 / Midterm Project: Medicare and Opioid Analysis with Python](https://github.com/Ayalaaa09/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Juypter%20Notebook%20Files/BAN6005_Mid_Term__Anthony_Ayala.ipynb)
The goal of this project was to answer 10 analysis questions each requiring 1 table and at least 1 chart along with devising 5 of my own analysis questions. The final deliverable beyond the code and analysis was an executive summary that highlighted my thoughts of analysis and conclusions that I drew from the data.
- Data: Several CSV files (Physicians, Scripts, and Zip Codes) from MonkeyWrenchGang/MGTPPython/main/modeule_5/mid-term at Github
